# OWASP Top 10

I really liked this course. It's not a course, per se, more of a video series. Having said that, it's presented by John Wagnon who I really enjoy listening to. He's great at explaining things and clearly very knowledgable. The 'course' is a series of videos where John explains each of the vulnerabilities in the list. However John goes a step further and gives examples on how these vulnerabilities are exploited, how to tell if you're vulnerable and possible resolution methods. Overall I found it really informative and gives you a really good foundation as to what these vulnerabilities are.

The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for 2021:

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection Attacks
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

There is a short quiz at the end of each series, which are broken up into 5 videos each. A nice bonus to this series was the inclusion of a few topics from the 2017 list which were not included in the 2017 list:

1. XML External Entities
2. Cross Site Scripting
3. Insecure Deserialization
