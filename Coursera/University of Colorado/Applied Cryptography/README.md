# Applied Cryptography - University of Colorady

This video series was a useful introduction to cryptography, however it was a little more high-level than I'd prefer. I'm someone who likes to really understand something from the ground up. So learning things like the mathematics, the rationale and the specifics behind algorithms and cryptosystems appeals to me.

So while it was definitely useful, I don't think I got as much out of it as I'd hoped. I found Christof Paar's video series on YouTube more to my liking, and following on with his textbook provides a much deeper understanding of cryptography in my opinion.
